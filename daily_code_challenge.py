# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
# This problem was recently asked by Google.
# Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
# For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
# Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

# ab, ac, ad, bc, bd, cd

# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

# This problem was asked by Jane Street.

# cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.

# Given this implementation of cons:

# def cons(a, b):
#     def pair(f):
#         return f(a, b)
#     return pair
# Implement car and cdr.


def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair


print(cons(3, 4))
